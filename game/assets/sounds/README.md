# Audio Assets

This directory should contain the following audio files for the audio demo:

- `ambient_hum.ogg` - A looping ambient humming sound
- `beep.wav` - A short beeping sound for testing spatial audio
- `wind_ambience.ogg` - Wind ambience for background atmosphere
- `impact.wav` - A short impact sound for one-shot testing

You can use any royalty-free sounds or generate them using tools like:
- Audacity (for recording/editing)
- sfxr/Bfxr (for retro game sounds)
- FreeSound.org (for royalty-free samples)

Recommended formats:
- OGG Vorbis for music and long ambiences (better compression)
- WAV for short sound effects (lower latency)
