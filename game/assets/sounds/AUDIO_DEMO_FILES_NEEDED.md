# Audio Demo Files Needed

To run the audio demo scene, you need to add the following sound files to this directory:

1. **ambient_hum.ogg** - A looping ambient sound (e.g., machinery hum, room tone)
2. **beep.wav** - A short beep or notification sound

## File Requirements

- Supported formats: OGG Vorbis (.ogg), WAV (.wav)
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz or 48kHz recommended
- Channels: Mono or stereo (mono recommended for 3D spatial sounds)

## Free Sound Resources

## Testing Without Sound Files

The audio demo will still load without these files, but you'll see warnings in the console about missing audio files.
