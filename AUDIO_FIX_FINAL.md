# Audio System Fix - Final Solution

## The Problem
The audio system was storing decoded raw audio samples (Vec<i16>) instead of the original file data. When trying to play sounds, it attempted to decode these raw samples as if they were MP3/WAV files, resulting in "end of stream" errors.

## The Fix
Changed `AudioEngine::load_sound()` to:
1. Load the original file bytes into memory
2. Verify the file is valid by test-decoding it
3. Store the original file bytes (not decoded samples)

This allows the `play_sound()` method to properly create a Decoder from the stored data.

## Changes Made
- Fixed `engine/src/audio/engine.rs`: Store original file bytes instead of decoded samples
- Made `audio_system_state` public in `EngineApp`
- Added audio update system call to editor mode
- Removed audio from default features to prevent build issues

## Testing
Run the game with: `cargo run --features editor,audio`
Or use the provided batch files:
- `run_with_audio.bat` - Run with audio enabled
- `run_audio_debug.bat` - Run with debug logging
- `test_audio.bat` - Test audio system in isolation

The audio should now play correctly!
