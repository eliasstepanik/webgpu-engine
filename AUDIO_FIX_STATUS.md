# Audio System Fix Status

## Summary
The audio system was not playing sounds due to two main issues:
1. Build environment mismatch (WSL vs Windows native)
2. Missing audio system update call in editor mode

## Issues Fixed

1. **Removed audio from default features** - The audio feature is no longer enabled by default in `game/Cargo.toml`, preventing ALSA build failures in WSL.

2. **Removed hardcoded audio feature from editor** - The editor's Cargo.toml no longer forces the audio feature to be enabled.

3. **Made audio_system_state public** - Changed the `audio_system_state` field in EngineApp to be public so it can be accessed from the game crate.

4. **Added audio update system to editor mode** - The editor mode update loop in `game/src/main.rs` now calls the audio update system when the audio feature is enabled, including the required delta_time parameter.

## How to Run with Audio

### On Windows (Native)
Use the provided batch file:
```
run_with_audio.bat
```

Or run manually with:
```
cargo run --features editor,audio
```

### Build Environment Note
This project appears to be developed in WSL but executed on Windows natively. The audio system uses the `rodio` crate which requires:
- **Linux/WSL**: ALSA development libraries (`libasound2-dev` on Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Windows**: No additional dependencies (uses WASAPI)

Since you're running natively on Windows, you need to build the project in a Windows environment (not WSL) for audio to work properly.

## Testing Audio
1. Run the game with audio feature enabled
2. Load the audio demo scene: `SCENE=audio_demo cargo run --features editor,audio`
3. You should hear the ambient hum sound playing
4. Check the AudioSource components in the inspector - they should show `is_playing: Yes` when playing

## Known Issues

### "Invalid MPEG audio header" Warnings
When loading WAV files, you may see many warnings like:
```
WARN symphonia_bundle_mp3::demuxer: invalid mpeg audio header
WARN symphonia_bundle_mp3::demuxer: skipping junk at XXXXX bytes
```

These warnings are harmless and occur because Symphonia (the audio decoding library used by Rodio) tries different decoders to identify the file format. The MP3 decoder is tried first and fails (generating warnings) before the correct WAV decoder is used. The audio should still play correctly despite these warnings.

## Debugging Audio Issues

Use the provided debug script to see detailed audio logs:
```
run_audio_debug.bat
```

This will show:
- When sounds are loaded
- When audio sources start/stop playing
- Spatial audio calculations
- Any actual errors (not just warnings)

## Remaining Work
If audio still doesn't play after these fixes, check:
1. Windows audio device is working (test with other applications)
2. The AudioListener component is present in the scene (attached to camera)
3. Volume levels are not set to 0
4. The audio files exist at the specified paths
