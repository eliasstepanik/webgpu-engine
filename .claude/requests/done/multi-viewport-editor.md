## FEATURE:

Enable multi-viewport support in the editor, allowing users to drag editor panels outside the main window to create detached, independent windows. This feature will provide flexible workspace arrangements across multiple monitors and improve the editor's usability for complex workflows.

Key capabilities:
- Drag any editor panel (scene view, properties, hierarchy, etc.) outside the main window
- Detached panels become independent OS windows
- Seamless transition between docked and floating states
- Multi-monitor support with proper DPI handling
- Window state persistence between sessions

## EXAMPLES:

Examples demonstrating multi-viewport functionality will be provided in `.claude/examples/multi-viewport/`:
- `basic_detach.rs` - Simple example showing how to detach a panel
- `multi_monitor_setup.rs` - Example of editor layout across multiple monitors
- `window_events.rs` - Handling window-specific events and input
- `shared_state.rs` - Demonstrating state synchronization between windows

## DOCUMENTATION:

Key documentation references needed during development:
- **ImGui Docking/Viewport Documentation**: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking
- **ImGui Multi-Viewport Branch**: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking
- **winit Multi-Window Support**: https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/window/
- **wgpu Multi-Surface Rendering**: https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.Surface.html
- **egui-winit Integration**: https://docs.rs/egui-winit/latest/egui_winit/
- **Platform-Specific Window APIs**:
  - Windows: Win32 window management
  - Linux: X11/Wayland protocols
  - macOS: NSWindow handling

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

### Performance Considerations:
- GPU resource sharing between windows must be efficient
- Avoid duplicating scene data across windows
- Minimize draw calls when rendering to multiple surfaces

### Platform-Specific Gotchas:
- **Windows**: Handle high-DPI scenarios correctly, especially when windows span monitors with different DPI
- **Linux**: Support both X11 and Wayland backends
- **macOS**: Respect macOS window management conventions (fullscreen spaces, Mission Control)

### Common AI Assistant Mistakes to Avoid:
1. **Not enabling viewport feature flags**: ImGui's multi-viewport support requires specific feature flags in both ImGui and the platform backend
2. **Incorrect event routing**: Each window needs proper event handling - don't route all events to the main window
3. **Resource lifecycle**: Properly handle GPU resources when windows are created/destroyed
4. **State synchronization**: Editor state must be properly shared, not duplicated
5. **Platform testing**: Test on all three major platforms - behavior differs significantly

### Technical Requirements:
- Maintain 60 FPS with up to 4 detached windows
- Support window arrangements on up to 3 monitors
- Graceful handling of monitor disconnection
- Proper cleanup when windows are closed
- No memory leaks from window creation/destruction cycles

### Integration Points:
- Current editor state management system
- Existing ImGui integration
- Scene rendering pipeline
- Input handling system
- Configuration/settings persistence
